NEW QUESTIONS
do we need player on landing page since there is no option to select a song from the landing page?  
will it play a random song by default until one is selected?  
will it continue to play during navigation (maybe it will since it probably won't be re-rendering)

how do we handle Redux state for data that won't be changing...for example the vibes?
ANSWER...declare their initial state in the seeds.  still provide a reducer to hydrate redux from db query on component mount so ui can populate

how to refactor vibes to not pass props since we're using Redux?
same for artist tile?
ACTUALLY IT'S DONE THAT WAY IN THE MODULE SO IT APPEARS TO BE AN ACCEPTABLE PATTERN
