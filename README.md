## Concept
Buskr provides a platform for musicians to showcase their songs to music fans who are interested in breaking free from the global trendscape in order to discover local acts performing nearby.  
  
  - Creators generate a profile featuring a photo, bio, location and music files
  - Consumers can filter musicians by "vibe" to find interesting new music
  - Consumers can listen to tracks while they peruse a creator's profile
  - Consumers can donate to creators using Stripe  
    

### User Stories  
I. As a **busker** looking for increased visibility in a socially distant world, I want an app that allows me to showcase my music alongside my location.  

II. As a **busker** looking to showcase myself online, I need an app that performs even with intermittent connectivity.

III. As a **music fan** starved for live shows during COVID-ian lockdown, I want a music app that showcases obscure performers near me.

IV. As a **music fan**, I don't just want to access the same old favorites, so I want an app that is geared toward discovery.
